# Scala - Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems which can be solved independently. DP is used to optimize recursive algorithms by storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

## Key Concepts

- **Overlapping Subproblems**: The problem can be broken down into smaller, repeating subproblems.
- **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
- **Memoization**: Storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.
- **Tabulation**: Building a table in a bottom-up manner to solve the problem.
