# Car Toll Project

Build an REST car tool service where the cars should be registered in the database using slick and the toll 
should charge different values per type of car, i.e bikes 7 usd, cars 13 usd, trucks 20 usd. Everytime a vehicle 
passes the toll that should be recorded on the database. The toll should have an operation to list all cars that 
passed given a day.
